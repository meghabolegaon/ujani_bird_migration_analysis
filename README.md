# Bird Migration Analysis at Ujani Dam

This project performs an exploratory data analysis of seasonal bird migration
patterns at Ujani Dam using Python. The goal is to understand seasonal
variations in bird abundance and species diversity, and to identify dominant
migratory species.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas (data manipulation)
- Matplotlib (data visualization)
- Google Colab
- GitHub

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset is an Excel file containing observational bird data from
Ujani Dam with the following attributes:

- `species_name` – Name of the bird species  
- `season` – Season of observation  
- `bird_count` – Number of birds recorded  

---

## Analysis Performed
- Seasonal aggregation of total bird counts  
- Seasonal species diversity analysis  
- Identification of top 10 most abundant bird species  
- Visualization of trends using bar charts  

---

## Running the Notebook
The analysis is designed to run in **Google Colab**.

Due to the temporary nature of Colab runtimes, the dataset is uploaded manually
using `files.upload()` at the beginning of the notebook rather than relying on
repository-relative file paths.

---

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab  
2. Upload `ujani_bird_migration.xlsx` when prompted  
3. Run all cells sequentially

## Outcomes
- Identification of peak migration seasons  
- Insights into seasonal biodiversity at Ujani Dam  
- Recognition of dominant migratory bird species
